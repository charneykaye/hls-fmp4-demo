# HLS Fragmented MP4 demo

Here's my HLS playlist:

* [chunky.m3u8](chunky.m3u8)

I'm able to stream that link using [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/). However **I hear a tiny audio error** like "skipping" in between each of the 10-second segments.

Here's my initialization segment:

* [chunky-128k-IS.mp4](chunky-128k-IS.mp4)

And here are the fragmented mp4 segments generated by encoding AAC audio in `ffmpeg` and then writing only the media fragment to an .m4s using [java mp4parser](https://github.com/sannies/mp4parser):

* [chunky-128k-163840683.m4s](chunky-128k-163840683.m4s)
* [chunky-128k-163840684.m4s](chunky-128k-163840684.m4s)
* [chunky-128k-163840685.m4s](chunky-128k-163840685.m4s)
* [chunky-128k-163840686.m4s](chunky-128k-163840686.m4s)
* [chunky-128k-163840687.m4s](chunky-128k-163840687.m4s)
* [chunky-128k-163840688.m4s](chunky-128k-163840688.m4s)

Here are detailed lab notes about the process I developed to create these:
